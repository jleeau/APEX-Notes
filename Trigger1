Triggers
  First event: insert. Any time a record is created. A corresponding trigger will run.
  Second event: update. When one or many records are changed on existing records.
  Third event: delete. When records are deleted.
  
Triggers do not require visualforce or lightning, which is why it's good to learn first.

Trigger requirements:
  1. Actual trigger
  2. Test Class - An Apex class that makes sure trigger runs properly. Verifies if your trigger works.
  TDD (Test Driven Development) - Write test classes even before triggers are written.
