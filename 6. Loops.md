## **Loops**
## **Two Types of Loops**
- FOR EACH Loop. Requires a collection, like a list, and does a loop for each record in the collection.
- FOR Loop. Doesn't require a collection, but defines an Integer i to run a specific number of iterations. Most commonly used in test classes.
  
 **FOR EACH LOOP**
 	- Iterates each record within a collection. 
	
```Apex
 List<Lead> leadList = new List<Lead>();
 leadList.add('hatGirl');
 leadList.add('bearMan');
 leadList.add('theBoss');

 for (Lead myLead : leadList) {
	//Set default field values
	myLead.Status = 'Open';
	myLead.LeadSource = 'Web';

	//Set anti-spam values
	myLead.DoNotCall = true;
	myLead.HasOptedOutOfFax = true;
	myLead.hasOptedOutOfEmail = true;
 }
 //THIS ONLY SETS VARIABLES IN APEX; THEY HAVE NOT BEEN SET IN THE DATABASE UNTIL DML STATEMENT IS MADE.
 ```

**FOR LOOP**
	- Used in test classes. Run something a certain amount of times by specifying a run condition (limit) and an increment.
	
```Apex
for (Integer = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
	Account acc = new Account();
	acc.Name = 'SFDC' + i;
	acc.Website = 'sfdc' + i + '.com';
	insert acc;
}
```


### **COMMON LOOP TOOLS**
**break**: break out of a loop and cancel future iterations. Use it in a for-each loop to look for a particular record.
	
```Apex
for (Case myCase : Trigger.new) {
	if (myCase.CaseNumber == '001') {
		importantCase = myCase;

		break;
	}
}
```

**continue**: move on to the next iteration of the loop and skip the rest of the code block in that iteration.

```Apex
for (Case myCase : caseList) {
	if (myCase.Status != 'New') {
		continue;
	}
}
```


### **DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE (DML)**
- Basically a save button. If there is no DML, all changes to the record exist in APEX only.

- **3 Types of DML**:
	- **Insert**: Inserts a new SObject record. Can be of any time.
	- **Update**: Updates an existing SObject record.
	- **Delete**: Deletes an existing SObject record.
	
- **2 Ways to Use DML**:
- **Single record DML**: Save one record at a time.
```Apex
Case newCase = new Case();

newCase.Subject = 'Bad code';
newCase.Priority = 'High';

insert newCase;
```
	
- **Multi-record DML**: save multiple records at once, up to 200.
```Apex
List<Case> cases = new List<Case>();

cases.add(myCase);
cases.add(yourCase);

delete cases;
```

- _ALWAYS_ use DML, unless... the records are in Trigger.new, and you're in a "before" trigger. This is because these triggers run before the event that saves the action.

### **Example 1**
We need to use DML statement, because the record we are inserting is not part of Trigger.new (Trigger list contains any inserted accounts, but we actually want to make changes to a new Opportunity and then insert that).

```Apex
trigger AutoCreateOpportunity on Account (after insert) {
	for (Account acc : Trigger.new) {
		Opportunity opp = new Opportunity();
		opp.Name = 'Big Deal';
		opp.CloseDate = Date.today().addMonths(3);
		opp.StageName = 'Prospecting';
		opp.AccountId = acc.Id;
		
		insert opp;
	}
}
```

### **Example 2**
Do not need DML. The record we use DML on is within the Trigger.new. If you update a Lead, it will do this stuff first, then it will automatically save.

```Apex
trigger NeverCallCeos on Lead (before update) {
	for (Lead myLead : Trigger.new) {
		if (myLead.Title == 'CEO') {
			myLead.DoNotCall = true;
			update myLead;	//Do not need DML on this line
		}
	}
}
```


### **Example 3**
Yes, do need DML. All records entering the Trigger.new is a Contact. However, the trigger loop creates a new Task, which is a separate thing. The new "Task" and its set variables will float in APEX until it is DML inserted for each Contact updated.

```Apex
trigger GovRecordChangeAlert on Contact (before update) {
	for (Contact myContact : Trigger.new) {
		if (myContact.Government_Record__c == true) {
			Task myTask = new Task();
			myTask.Subject = 'Government record modified';
			myTask.Description = 'Please verify updates.';
			MyTask.Status = 'Not Started';
			
			insert myTask;
		}
	}
}
```
