##**SOQL - Salesforce Object Query Language*

//TIM'S USE CASE: INSTEAD OF HIGHLIGHTING STUFF IN REPORT, BUILD THE FILTER INTO THE SOQL QUERY.
//SO ONLY THE THINGS THAT CAN BE PAID, SHOULD BE PAID.
//IDEA IS TO LINK IT TO A VF PAGE AND ANYTHING ON THAT LIST CAN BE PAID.
//OPTIONAL: EVERY TIME CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED, TRIGGERS A NOTE/EMAIL TO TIM.
//HAVE TWO REPORTBLOCKS, ONE THAT IMITATES THE REGULAR REPORT, ANOTHER THAT REFINES IT TO PAYABLE CLIENTS

- Search org for any record or settings.
- SOQL lets you access any records that aren't in Trigger.new, i.e. in Salesforce
- Similar to Reports, both have a primary use case of finding records
- SOQL is runs quicker because it is the pure code without the UI.
- Use SOQL instead of Data Loader, because SOQL can do more things, e.g. cross-object queries, doesn't need CSV, and can be used in APEX.
	
**WHERE TO USE SOQL QUERY EDITOR**	
- Salesforce Workbench - Tool to manage org. including SOQL editor. SOQL Query builder.
- Developer Console - Query Editor. Saves SOQL query history.
	
	

**SOQL QUERIES**
- Every query requires SELECT and FROM bare minimum.
- Doesn't care about field types; just cares if the correct API name is used.
- Can't query ALL fields unlike SQL (SELECT *).

Examples: Basic
```Apex
	SELECT Field1, Field2, FieldX FROM ObjectName
	SELECT Id FROM Account
	SELECT Id, Name, Industry, Custom_Field__c FROM Account
	SELECT OwnerId, StageName, CloseDate, Amount, Probability, IsClosed FROM Opportunity
```

**HIDDEN OBJECTS**
- Can't do thiese in Reports because they're not accessible.

Examples: Hidden Objects
```Apex
	SELECT Id, Name, PermissionsViewAllData, PermissionsModifyAllData, PermissionsAuthorApex FROM Profile
	SELECT Id, Name, AssigneeId, PermissionSetId FROM PermissionSetAssignment
```

**FILTERED QUERIES**
- WHERE filter operators: =, !=, >, <=, IN, LIKE
- Date Literals: TODAY, TOMORROW, YESTERDAY, THIS_WEEK, NEXT_MONTH, LAST_YEAR

Examples: Filtered SOQL Queries
```Apex
	SELECT Id, FirstName, Phone 
	FROM Contact 
	WHERE (Department = 'Executive Team'
	OR Department = 'Finance'
	OR Department = 'Technology')
	AND DoNotCall = FALSE 
	AND Phone != null
	AND Birthdate < 1995-06-15
	AND Title LIKE '%VP%'		//Fuzzy matching. % is a wildcard: any no. of characters
	
	//Also can abbreviate the Department field as a 'Set'.
	WHERE Department IN ('Executive Team', 'Finance', 'Technology')
```
 
**SORTED QUERIES**
- Can organize results using ORDER BY query.

Examples: Ordered SOQL Queries
```Apex
	SELECT Id, Name, Amount, StageName
	FROM Opportunity
	WHERE StageName != 'Closed Lost'
	ORDER BY StageName DESC, Amount DESC			//ASC: ascending, DESC: descending. Can do layered sorting
	LIMIT 10										//At very end
```
	

##**ADVANCED SOQL**
	
**CROSS-OBJECT QUERIES**
- Lets you pull information from related/child records. 
- Traversing relationships. Relationships are made when there's a lookup OR master-detail relationship from one to another.
- Whatever object the relationship field sits on, the referred object is the parent object. E.g. 'Account' field an Opportunity; the Account is the Parent object. Account can have many opportunities (children), but each opportunity can have one account (parent).
- In the parent, there is no explicit relationship field to child objects, but it is a special hidden relationship field. It is the developer name of the related list, e.g. opportunities. Can find it through Workbench (info -> Object -> Child Object -> Relationship Name

Example: Querying Parent Data
```Apex
	SELECT Id, Amount, StageName,
		   Account.Name,
		   Account.Industry,
		   Account.Website
		   Account.Owner.Username		//Can query parent's parent data
	  FROM Opportunity
	 WHERE Account.Industry = 'Energy'
	   AND Account.AnnualRevenue > 5000
	   AND CreatedBy.Email != null
```

Example: Querying custom object parent
```Apex
	SELECT Id, Amount, StageName,
		   Sales_Plan__r.Goal__c,
		   Sales_Plan__r.Sponsor__c,
		   Sales_Plan__r.Qtr__r.Id,
		   Account.Industry
	  FROM Opportunity
	 WHERE Sales_Plan__r.Target__c > 0
```

Example: Inner Querying Child Data
```Apex
	SELECT Id,
		   Amount, 
		   StageName,
		   Account.Name
		   (SELECT Role, ContactId,
		   		   Contact.FirstName,		//Can have other parent queries inside inner queries
				   Contact.Email
	  	      FROM OpportunityContactRoles
		     WHERE Role != null
		       AND Role != 'Influencer')	//Inner query for child object. Don't refer to child object name, refer to hidden rel. name
	  FROM Opportunity
	  //Pulls all org's opportunities, and for each opp, pulls contact roles whether it has them or not.
```

Example: Inner Querying Child Data Custom
```Apex
	SELECT Id,
		   Amount,
		   StageName,
		   (SELECT Id,
		           Name,
				   Price__c
			  FROM Competition__r)
	FROM Opportunity
```		   

**GROUPED RESULTS QUERY**
- Like a summary report, allows grouping and aggregate data like sums and averages.

Example: Grouping SOQL Results
```Apex
	SELECT StageName,		//Once you use GROUP BY, can only include fields that are aggregate functions, except grouping field.
		   SUM(Amount)		//Need to tell SOQL what to aggregate (sum, avg, max) or it is invalid.
		   MAX(CloseDate),
		   MIN(ExpectedRevenue),
		   AVG(Amount),
		   AVG(Account.AnnualRevenue),
		   COUNT(Amount)	//Count all records in a group
		   COUNT(Id)
	  FROM Opportunity
	 WHERE Amount != null
  GROUP BY StageName
```


##**Examples**
