## **Test Classes**

- Apex code that tests other Apex code. A trigger's test code is companion code to make sure it works.
- Automates all the manual processes used to test triggers.
- It is essential to have test classes to make sure nothing breaks downstream.
- It is common to have a test class for every trigger.
- Name it after the trigger, e.g. HelloWorld -> HelloWorldTest
- The best practice for testclasses is to create records rather than edit existing ones. Test classes do not get saved permanently, and undoes any changes in our test.
- Don't use SeeAllData = True for @istest annotation in order to access organization records. Always create records from scratch.


**Requirements of SF code:**
- Cannot deploy code directly into production. Need 75% code coverage, i.e. 75% of all the code is run by a test class.
- All assertions must pass. It is a hypothesis in our test class. E.g. First Name must = 'Hello'.
	


### **TEST CLASS 1**
- Hello World Test Class.
- @: This is an annotation. @istest tells SF that we are writing a test class. Categorizes as a test class.
- To test TestTrigger1, update a lead.
- Because TestTrigger1 fires from a Lead update, all the class has to do is update a lead (after creating one).


```Apex
@istest
private class TestClass1 {
    @isTest static void updateLead() {
		Lead myLead = new Lead();
        myLead.FirstName = 'Jacky';
        myLead.LastName = 'Lee';
        myLead.Company = 'Google';
        insert myLead;
        
        myLead.Company = 'Shield';
        update myLead;
    }
}
```


### **TEST CLASS 2 - Apple Watch**
- Need to create an Opportunity.
- Can create date by accessing Date.something() function.


```Apex
@istest
private class AppleWatchTest {
    @istest static void createOpportunity() {
        Opportunity opp = new Opportunity();
        opp.Name = 'Swift Deal';
        opp.StageName = 'Prospecting';
        opp.CloseDate = Date.today();
        opp.Amount = 55000;
        
        insert opp;
    }
}
```


### **TEST CLASS 3 - DedupeReminder**
- 100% reminder for dedupe reminder.
- Trigger might have different OwnerId hardcoded. This trigger runs after Account is inserted.
- Below test class yields 100%.


```Apex
@istest
private class TestTrigger3Test {
    @istest static void createAccount() {
        Account acc = new Account();
        //acc.RecordTypeId = 'Client';		//Actually put in Client record ID here.
        acc.Name = 'TestName';
        acc.CurrencyIsoCode = 'USD';
        acc.OwnerId = '0056F000007ixu0';
        
        insert acc;
    }
}
```
